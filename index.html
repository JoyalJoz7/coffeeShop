        <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering
            plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product:
            unroasted green coffee.</p>
        <p>We believe that coffee is more than just a drink: It's a culture, an economy, an art, a science â€” and a
            passion. Whether you're new to the brew or an espresso expert, whether you prefer it with or without
            caffeine, there's always more to learn about America's favorite beverage.</p>

        <h2 id="f1">ESPRESSO</h2>
        <div class="grow"><img id="im2" src="./images/espresso.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p>The espresso, also known as a short black, is approximately 1 oz. of highly concentrated coffee. Although
            simple in appearance, it can be difficult to master.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="c1">
        <h2 id="f1">RED EYE</h2>
        <div class="grow"><img id="im2" src="./images/red-eye-coffee-recipe-XS.jpg   " alt=""></div>
        <p>The red eye's purpose is to add a boost of caffeine to your standard cup of coffee.</p>

    <div class="c1">
        <h2 id="f1">AMERICANO</h2>
        <div class="grow"><img id="im2" src="./images/Americano-Coffee-with-Milk.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p>Americanos are popular breakfast drinks and thought to have originated during World War II. Soldiers would
            add water to their coffee to extend their rations farther. The water dilutes the espresso while still
            maintaining a high level of caffeine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="c1">
        <h2 id="f1">MACCCHIATO</h2>
        <div class="grow"><img id="im2" src="./images/machhi.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p>The word macchiato means mark or stain. This is in reference to the mark that steamed milk leaves on the
            surface of the espresso as it is dashed into the drink. Flavoring syrups are often added to the drink
            according to customer preference.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="c1">
        <h2 id="f1">CORTADO</h2>
        <div class="grow"><img id="im2" src="./images/cortado.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p>The cortado takes the macchiato one step further by evenly balancing the espresso with warm milk in order to
            reduce the acidity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="c1">
        <h2 id="f1">CAPPUCCINO</h2>
        <div class="grow"><img id="im2" src="./images/cappuccino.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p>This creamy coffee drink is usually consumed at breakfast time in Italy and is loved in the United States as
            well. It is usually associated with indulgence and comfort because of its thick foam layer and additional
            flavorings that can be added to it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="c1">
        <h2 id="f1">MOCHA</h2>
        <div class="grow"><img id="im2" src="./images/mocha.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p>The mocha is considered a coffee and hot chocolate hybrid. The chocolate powder or syrup gives it a rich and
            creamy flavor and cuts the acidity of the espresso.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="c1">
        <h2 id="f1">AFFOGATOS</h2>
        <div class="grow"><img id="im2" src="./images/affogat.jpeg" alt=""></div>
        <p>Affogatos are more for a dessert coffee than a drink you would find at a cafe, but they can add a fun twist
            to your coffee menu. They are made by pouring a shot of espresso over a scoop of vanilla ice cream to create
            a sweet after-meal treat.</p>
